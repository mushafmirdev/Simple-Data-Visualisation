# Simple Data Visualisation with Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to use Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize the famous **Iris dataset**.  
We also explore basic preprocessing and generate several visual insights including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

---

## Features Visualized

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Target Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

---

## Visualizations

- **Histograms** for distribution of each feature
- **Box Plots** to detect outliers
- **Scatter Plots** with `hue` to separate species visually

---

## Learning Outcomes
Understanding of basic data visualization techniques

Use of hue in Seaborn for multi-class comparison

Boxplots and histograms for feature distributions
